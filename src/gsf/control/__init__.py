"""Control Module
==============
The simulation control module is composed of abstractions for the control and execution of simulation strategies, and concrete classes that implement specific functionalities.

All the control components belonging to the framework have the functionalities to start, pause, stop, wait and execute a simulation. While the control class for discrete event simulation implements the functionalities and adds others such as time control.
